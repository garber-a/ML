Each model type has its own jupyter notebook. To run the code, launch a Jupyter notebook session and
open the notebook. 

The jupyter notebooks can be found here: https://github.com/garber-a/ML

Ensure that your python environment has sklearn, pandas, numpy, graphviz, and matplotlib.

The top portion of each notebook runs analysis on the california housing datset (regression). 
The bottom of the notebook contains the code for the MNIST dataset (classification).
