Each model type has its own jupyter notebook. To run the code, launch a Jupyter notebook session and
open the notebook. 

The jupyter notebooks can be found here: https://github.com/garber-a/ML/Project2

Ensure that your python environment has sklearn, pandas, numpy, and mlrose 
(can be installed with pip install -e git+git://github.com/hiive/mlrose#egg=mlrose-hiive).

Run each notebook sequentially. To obtain the same results as in the analysis document,
filter through the results for the optimal fitness score with the least iterations.
