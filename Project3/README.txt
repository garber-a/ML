Each dataset has its own jupyter notebook. To run the code, launch a Jupyter notebook session and
open the notebook. All relevant graphs are created in the jupyter notebooks.

The jupyter notebooks can be found here: https://github.com/garber-a/ML/edit/master/Project3

Ensure that your python environment has sklearn, pandas, numpy

Run each notebook sequentially. To obtain the same results as in the analysis document.
